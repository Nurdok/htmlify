# About:

HTMLify is a mini side project I worked on mainly to get a feel of being a full-stack web developer and creating something from nothing. I created it because, for use in my blog, I used to "convert" code snippets to HTML-compatible format by hand or by a vi script and it's quite annoying.

Check it out online at http://www.htmlify.net/

## Installation and running

Once you clone the app, you must install the dependencies before running 

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

For running the app, run this on your command line:

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:3333

You can then start your favourite browser on [http://0.0.0.0:3333](http://0.0.0.0:3333) or [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)
